<h2>ART 151: Creative Coding</h2>

<p>This class is the introduces students to computer programming with an emphasis on creative design and data visualization. I learn techniques to translate raw data into compelling audio and visual projects. Composing a series of projects throughout the semester, to experiment and develop own strategies to creatively write code. Completed the class with technical skills that will lay the foundation for more advanced programming, scripting, and web development.</p>	

<p>this course is to establish a foundational understanding of digital and code environments as art making tools. Through lectures, screenings, and workshops, students will learn about the social, political, and personal relationships these technologies form in our everyday lives. Students will also form a critical foundation through investigations into theories and histories.</p>

<p>Basic understanding of how computers, networks, and code work. A general understanding of how to read and write new media using various techniques such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Generative systems, and Art Games.</p>

<p>Using HTML and CSS create a fanpage for anything you want. I have chosen to make a Fan page of my favorite band, Motionless in White. I have completed the requirement they asked me to complete the fanpage. I had to make at least 4 separate pages. Use styles in CSS file. Also Must include media of some sort on each page (images, video, audio).

<a href="https://lrueda2.github.io/360Attack/" target="_blank"><h3>p5 Project (360 Attack)</h3></a>
<p>Using a combination of variables, images, for loops, animations, conditionals, statements, text, color, etc. create an application that uses keyboard and mouse user input. This can be an animation, a simple game, a drawing machine type app, etc. This was my first time using p5.js and I was excited to learn this language. I had to make one for loop, two conditional statements, mouse input, and keyboard input. This only runs on PC/MAC inorder to move, you must click house the left mouse key and move with the arrow keys. To clear the stretch, just refresh the page.

<a href="https://lrueda2.github.io/surprise.story/" target="_blank"><h3>Web Narrative Project (Surprise Story)</h3></a>
<p>Using p5, HTML, and CSS create an interactive narrative web app that uses interactive elements such as sliders, buttons, color, clicks, text boxes, etc. The narrative can be whatever I want, from something as ordinary as a commute, to something imagined like an alien invasion, or a narrative that endlessly loops to mess with a viewers idea of time and space.</p> 
	
<p>For the project I had to create a minimum of 5 different 'scenes' that are triggered by different interactions
Use a minimum of 3 different HTML input elements to progress the narrative, e.g. buttons, sliders, links, selects, etc.
Every scene should have an interactive element on the page. This only runs on PC/MAC.</p>

<a href="https://lrueda2.github.io/VirtualConcert20/" target="_blank"><h3>Final Project (Virtual Concert)</h3></a>
<p>This can be a significant expansion of a previous project or a completely new project. This project can be a game, an interactive narrative, an interactive 'installation', a webcam app, a data driven app, or a combination of any of these. This is an opportunity to connect to personal interests with the course content in a way that is interesting. Therefore, I have decided to make a virtual concert website. I decided to make this because I was so bored during quartine and sad that all events (such as concert/music festival) were cancelled. Therefore, I made a website for to get the feel of being at a concert. Especially, that I use javascript, which it my favorite project because I have advance my skills from the beginning of class through the end of class. This only runs on PC/MAC</p>
