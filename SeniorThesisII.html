<h2>DES 481: Senior Thesis II</h2>
<p>This is the same as Senior Thesis I, but I decided to work on a different topic for this project I had worked on. I had to research under that topic and some was inspired by my own investigations and expierence.</p>

<h2>1st Latinidad</h2>
<p>Latinx immigrants are known to be hard-working, learning a new language, building a better life for themselves and their children, sending their children to college. But many Latin American households maintain not only their native tongue but the valores (Spanish for values) of their homeland. For children this can be stressful because it means one is expected to keep a foot in both cultures. As a first gen Latinx designer 2who has experienced the struggles facing children who are forced to navigate between such cultural extremes, Latinidad chronicles the shared experiences of others who, like me, often feel misunderstood. At the same time, it encourages empathy. Being misunderstood is a cultural disconnect that can be overcome when differences are share and appreciated.</p>
<p>Throughout the years attending the university, I had struggle with identity and felt like an imposter in my own body. Like I should feel grateful I had made it this far in my life, but the otherside still feel guilty or like an alien in my own home. Though I am grateful that my university has resources and a community of Latinx, like me, to connect with others and support each other.</p>
<p>I also thank those who had voluteer and being able to share their expierence of what it's like being 1st gen latinx in a higher education.</p>

<p>I decided to make this a webpage because I want this to be an interactive as the audience read through the paragraph from 1st gen latinx steudents I had interviewed. It was fun to interview because I realized that I wasn't alone in this long journey and not alone with this odd feeling as I was different from my peers on campus. I used HTML, CSS, P5.JS, and some javascript to this webpage. I recommend using this website on google chrome for better quality.</p>
