<a href="Form&Image/project2.pdf"><h3>Project 2: Pictogram Book</h3></a>
<p>I create a visual narrative of a news story using only pictograms, symbols and icons. No text other than numbers.I chose a news that could be on Science, U.S., World, Health, Business or Tech. I collected your pictograms, symbols and icons. I arrange them in an narrative order so that during critique we are able to explain my story.</p>
<p>The news I picked is from Mexico. It about Trans-women fighting their right inorder to survive in the world. Mexico is one od the deadlist country, which high percentage increase that Trans women are being attacked/killed. Not only that, but also they're not getting respect or feel safe in home. It stood out to me because I'm Mexican and I'm aware of the violence it been going on, but high increase towards the LGBT community just devasted me.</p>
