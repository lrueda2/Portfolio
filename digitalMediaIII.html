<h2>DES 250: Digital Media III</h2>
<p>Motion basics and advanced narrative/storytelling through motion. Expands motion literacy into narrative sequence planning, animation design process, and multimedia technologies.
Process phases include research, concept, formulation/exploration, experiments/tests, selection and refinement, storyboard, animation using Adobe After Effects.</p>

<ul>
<li>— understand and apply motion literacy (WHAT and HOW something can move to communicate effectively)</li>
<li>— create digital animations using motion graphics </li>
<li>— create meaningful animations on an abstract level </li>
<li>— design with type for motion</li>
<li>— demonstrate understanding for graphic sequence and transition</li>
<li>— use animation software</li>
<li>— integrate audio components</li>
</ul>

<h3>E-motion</h3>
<p>This assignment is a simple intro to motion graphics. Understand and create digital animations/motion graphics. The goal is to visualize contrasting emotions with the means of motion. To visualize an idea with the means of motion on an abstract level using type (no sound, color, shape, image etc.). These simple animations give you the opportunity to use and apply the elemental building blocks of animation as well as to learn the basics of Adobe After Effects. I made the letter E letter move energetic and timid.</p></div>

<h4>Kinetic Typography: The Moving Poster</h4>
<p>Create a kinetic/moving poster for an event. The message should be communicated with the means of Typography in motion. Images can be used as supporting visuals such as related/appropriate textures but images should not be the means of communication in this case. Create a short animated sequence that loops. It should repeat itself without interruption. And not matter when someone is looking at the poster, the main message (name of conference) should be legible within approx. 3 second. I'm guessing that the loop shouldn't be much longer that about 10 seconds.</p></div>

<h5>Flow Loop</h5>
<p>Create motion loops using the word "flow". It was an opportunity for me to experiment and explore motion (and After Effects) further on a fundamental level combining simple form (type) and motion/sequence with the goal of communicating something with the means of motion. </p></div>

<h6>Film Titles</h6>
<p>I developed a film title sequence. The objective is to create anticipation and to set the film’s tone. I used Typography and motion to express ideas and create a narrative. I must pick a movie and so some research by watching the movie and take note of the theme. The movie I had picked is Nightmare on Elm Street.</p></div>
