<p>Hello, I’m Linda Rueda Ramirez and my pronouns are her/she/ella. I am a recent graduate at the University of Illinois at Chicago with a Bachelor of Design in Graphic Design. I’m born and raised in Chicago. I'm very friendly and like to try out new things. I'm bilingual, so I speak, read, and write English and Spanish. I like drawing, painting, photography, fitness, music, food, and travel. </p>
	
<p>I'm full of curiosity, which I take my time and dedication to experiment, explore, and to aim towards the goal. I like to experiment with the variety of tools I have in my hands in order to create the design piece, whether it be digital or physical. I explore the design options by making various designs to see which one is suitable, and which one needs to be fixed and modified. I also explore my options by being in the audience’s shoes to see if the design is eye-catching. I can work within a group or solo, I get to work by contributing ideas, asking questions, and to hear others' thoughts. I’m ready to hear feedback from my peers, so I will not take harsh criticism in a bad way because I know that it would be an opportunity to grow and learn as a design to fix those mistakes. I will take on the challenges in order to get to her goals and to grow as a designer.  Overall, I'm seeking the opportunity to improve and develop my skills as a Graphic Designer. I'm willing to take challenges and overcome obstacles in order to grow and have more experience as a Designer.</p>
